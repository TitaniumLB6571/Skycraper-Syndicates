# Skycraper-Syndicates
a pocketmine 5 skyscraper mini game

Skyline Syndicates is a fast, competitive 4-team (4 players each) vertical race inside a massive skyscraper where each floor is a distinct challenge (parkour, puzzles, PvE, PvP or hybrids), PvP is always enabled (team damage off), players respawn with a ~10s penalty at their last floor checkpoint, and the first team to reach and activate the rooftop beacon wins; matches use 8–12 randomized floors per skyscraper template, short rounds (~15–20 minutes), automatic team assignment, and spectator/drone mode for eliminated players who can mark enemies for brief intel. Performance tasks: when a match is queued the server must preload a skyscraper template and immediately clone it into an isolated instance (world clone) for that match, keep a small pool of preloaded template worlds to reduce startup lag, and stream/async-load chunks for only the currently active floors while unloading inactive ones to reduce entity/tick load; cap entity counts and use lightweight NPCs or armor-stand visuals instead of heavy pathfinding where possible, enforce strict mob/particle limits, snapshot and rollback instance areas after each match, and persist minimal instance state in SQLite/JSON with periodic async saves to avoid main-thread stalls. Match management and reliability: hold players in a waiting lobby until 16 players are present (or until a configurable timeout/auto-fill policy), then atomically allocate a cloned world instance, assign teams, and start a synchronized timer; implement robust anti-cheat checks, server-side checkpointing per floor, server-authoritative respawn and loot distribution, per-match logs for replay/forensics, automatic cleanup and garbage collection of instances after match end, and admin commands for manual reset/force-end; additionally include telemetry and stress-test tooling to monitor tick rate, memory, and entity counts so you can tune floor designs and scheduled events to keep matches smooth.
